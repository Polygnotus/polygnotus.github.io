While shooting for the Tamil film ''&#91;&#91;Guru Sishyan (2010 film)| Guru Sishyan ]]'' in 2010, she had worn a bikini for the song "Kathara Kathara" in that film. The film had received negative reviews and did poorly but was mainly remembered for that bikini scene in that song. She mentioned that she was asked to wear one and she readily agreed and said that she hadn‚Äôt even considered questions like how was it going to be shot or whether it was required or not, as all that mattered to her was the opportunity to be part of that film. The fact that she had worked in a Tamil film and worn a bikini had gone under the radar as according to her back then South Indian films didn't make much news outside of those states as compared to today where accesibility to news about South Indian films is easy thanks to social media, OTT platforms and theaters. However when she did her first Marathi daily soap ''&#91;&#91;Radha Hi Bawari]]'' in 2012 and gained fame in many households, many people out of curiosity started searching about her on the Internet with the first photo showing up of her in a bikini in a pool from one of those still photos of that film. Right after the first episode of the serial, she was heavily trolled on social media for those photos and the scene especially for the way it was shot.

The film had received negative reviews and did poorly but was mainly remembered for that bikini scene in that song. She mentioned that she was asked to wear one and she readily agreed and said that she hadn‚Äôt even considered questions like how was it going to be shot or whether it was required or not, as all that mattered to her was the opportunity to be part of that film. The fact that she had worked in a Tamil film and worn a bikini had gone under the radar as according to her back then South Indian films didn't make much news outside of those states as compared to today where accesibility to news about South Indian films is easy thanks to social media, OTT platforms and theaters. However when she did her first Marathi daily soap ''&#91;&#91;Radha Hi Bawari]]'' in 2012 and gained fame in many households, many people out of curiosity started searching about her on the Internet with the first photo showing up of her in a bikini in a pool from one of those still photos of that film.

  <td class="diff-context diff-side-deleted"><div>In 2019, Shruti revealed that she was trolled on social media when she just entered the Marathi film industry but this trolling turned into appreciation. While shooting for the Tamil film ''&#91;&#91;Guru Sishyan (2010 film)| Guru Sishyan ]]'' in 2010, she had worn a bikini for the song "Kathara Kathara" in that film. The film had received negative reviews and did poorly but was mainly remembered for that bikini scene in that song. She mentioned that she was asked to wear one and she readily agreed and said that she hadn‚Äôt even considered questions like how was it going to be shot or whether it was required or not, as all that mattered to her was the opportunity to be part of that film. The fact that she had worked in a Tamil film and worn a bikini had gone under the radar as according to her back then South Indian films didn't make much news outside of those states as compared to today where accesibility to news about South Indian films is easy thanks to social media, OTT platforms and theaters. However when she did her first Marathi daily soap ''&#91;&#91;Radha Hi Bawari]]'' in 2012 and gained fame in many households, many people out of curiosity started searching about her on the Internet with the first photo showing up of her in a bikini in a pool from one of those still photos of that film. Right after the first episode of the serial, she was heavily trolled on social media for those photos and the scene especially for the way it was shot. She was even bodyshamed for her weight in the beginning but she kept working as if that incident didn't bother her even though she was objectified on social media. Later on as the serial went on, she began to receive appreciation and love for her acting. &lt;ref&gt;&#123;&#123;Cite web| url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/news/shruti-marathe-shares-her-metoo-story-in-a-shocking-incident/articleshow/68750737.cms | title=Shruti shares about her MeToo story in a shocking incident | website=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>
